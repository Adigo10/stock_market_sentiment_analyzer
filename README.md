# AI6127-DNN: Financial News Analysis with Deep Learning

A comprehensive NLP project for stock analysis using financial news data, web scraping, and fine-tuned reasoning models.

## Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent financial news analysis system that:

1. **Scrapes Financial News**: Uses Groq API with GPT-OSS-20B and browser search to find top 10 financial news articles for any stock
2. **Processes Text Data**: Implements comprehensive text cleaning with custom financial term preservation
3. **Analyzes Sentiment**: Provides detailed sentiment analysis of financial news
4. **Generates Reasoning**: Fine-tunes models to explain why news events affect stock prices
5. **Delivers Insights**: Creates comprehensive reports and analysis summaries

#### Note: Prioritize output to JSON format, rewrite NLTK modules as custom code
