- **Custom CleanText Class**: Implements full preprocessing pipeline
- **Financial Term Preservation**: Maintains important financial vocabulary
- **Multi-step Cleaning**:
  1. Lowercase normalization
  2. Noise removal (HTML, URLs, irrelevant characters)
  3. Stop word removal with tokenization
  4. Lemmatization with WordNet

## News Sentiment Data Generator

The project includes a real-time news sentiment generator (`src/generate_synthetic_data.py`) that fetches AI company news and generates sentiment-classified data using the DeepSeek v3 API with web search capabilities.

ðŸ“– **[View Complete Usage Guide â†’](src/README_SENTIMENT_GENERATOR.md)**

### Setup

1. Ensure your `.env` file contains the DeepSeek API key:
   ```
   deepseeker_api_key=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Generate sentiment-classified news data in CSV format:

```powershell
# Fetch 10 recent news items (default) - creates new file or appends to existing
python .\src\generate_synthetic_data.py

# Fetch custom number of news items
python .\src\generate_synthetic_data.py --n 20 --out .\data\my_sentiment_data.csv

# Focus on specific companies
python .\src\generate_synthetic_data.py --n 15 --companies NVIDIA Microsoft OpenAI
```

**Note:** The script automatically **appends** new data to existing CSV files. The header is only written when creating a new file. This allows you to continuously accumulate news data over multiple runs.

### Output Format

The script generates a CSV file with three columns:

1. **source_name**: The publication name (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, TechCrunch)
2. **source**: A comprehensive 3-5 sentence summary of the full article content
3. **sentiment**: Formatted as `<senti>Good/Bad/Neutral<reason>analysis`

Example CSV output:
```csv
source_name,source,sentiment
Reuters,"NVIDIA announced record quarterly earnings with data center revenue surging 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion, driven by massive demand for its AI chips. The company provided strong forward guidance that exceeded analyst expectations.",<senti>Good<reason>Exceptional earnings beat demonstrates NVIDIA's dominant position in the AI chip market
The Information,"OpenAI is in early talks to raise new funding at a valuation of $100 billion or more. The potential funding round comes as the company continues to develop more advanced AI models.",<senti>Good<reason>Massive valuation increase signals strong investor confidence in OpenAI's growth potential
Bloomberg,"Tesla delays rollout of Full Self-Driving version 12 due to regulatory hurdles and technical challenges. The company is working with regulators to address safety concerns.",<senti>Bad<reason>Delays in key AI product launch may disappoint investors and impact revenue timeline
```

### Features

- **Real-time News**: Fetches latest news articles via DeepSeek API with web search
- **Article Summarization**: Reads full articles and generates comprehensive 3-5 sentence summaries
- **Source Attribution**: Captures publication names (Reuters, Bloomberg, etc.)
- **Automated Sentiment Classification**: AI-powered sentiment analysis (Good/Bad/Neutral)
- **Structured Output**: Clean CSV format with three columns for easy analysis
- **Append Mode**: Continuously accumulates data across multiple runs
