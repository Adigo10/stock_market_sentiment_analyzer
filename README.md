# AI6127-DNN: Financial News Analysis with Deep Learning - Text Pre-Processing

### Text Processing
- **Custom CleanText Class**: Implements full preprocessing pipeline
- **Financial Term Preservation**: Maintains important financial vocabulary
- **Multi-step Cleaning**:
  1. Lowercase normalization
  2. Noise removal (HTML, URLs, irrelevant characters)
  3. Stop word removal with tokenization
  4. Lemmatization with WordNet
